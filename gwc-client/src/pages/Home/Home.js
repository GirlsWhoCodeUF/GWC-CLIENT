                "Joining Girls Who Code was one of the best decisions I have
                ever made. As an introverted person, I often found it
                challenging to express myself and share my ideas with others.
                However, being a part of this organization has helped me break
                out of my shell and become more confident in my abilities.
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                Working alongside other girls my age who share the same
                passions, interests, and career goals as me has been an
                incredibly empowering experience. Knowing that I am not alone in
                my journey towards a career in technology makes me feel safe and
                supported within my field.
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                The tech industry can be intimidating, especially for women, who
                are often underrepresented and undervalued. However, being a
                part of Girls Who Code reassures me that I have a community of
                supportive, like-minded individuals who are there to help me
                navigate this challenging landscape.
                <p></p>
                <p></p>I am so grateful for everything that Girls Who Code has
                done for me. Thanks to this organization, I am now more
                confident, more passionate, and more motivated than ever before.
                I cannot wait to see what the future holds for me and for all of
                the amazing women in this organization."

                coding, and I've had the opportunity to serve as social chair,
                Vice President, and now President of the club. Through Girls Who
                Code, I've found a supportive community on campus that feels
                like a sisterhood. It's helped me feel more connected to my
                campus community and overcome imposter syndrome. I'm proud of
                the work we've done to promote coding, and I'm excited to
                continue as a leader and advocate for girls in tech."
