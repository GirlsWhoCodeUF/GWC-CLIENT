                "Joining Girls Who Code was one of the best decisions I have
                ever made. As an introverted person, I often found it
                challenging to express myself and share my ideas with others.
                However, being a part of this organization has helped me break
                out of my shell and become more confident in my abilities.
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                Working alongside other girls my age who share the same
                passions, interests, and career goals as me has been an
                incredibly empowering experience. Knowing that I am not alone in
                my journey towards a career in technology makes me feel safe and
                supported within my field.
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                The tech industry can be intimidating, especially for women, who
                are often underrepresented and undervalued. However, being a
                part of Girls Who Code reassures me that I have a community of
                supportive, like-minded individuals who are there to help me
                navigate this challenging landscape.
                <p></p>
                <p></p>I am so grateful for everything that Girls Who Code has
                done for me. Thanks to this organization, I am now more
                confident, more passionate, and more motivated than ever before.
                I cannot wait to see what the future holds for me and for all of
                the amazing women in this organization."
